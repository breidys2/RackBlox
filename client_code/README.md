This directory contains the client code that generates requests.
The code is written using DPDK v22.11.1 for packet processing 

For simplicity, we generate requests from traces generated by the testing workloads.

Note: Please replace the client and server ips in main.c with the ones for your topology. The current ones are placeholders.

Usage: ./run.sh <trace_name> <#Requests Sent> <#Expected Replies>
