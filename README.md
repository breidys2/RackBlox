# RackBlox: A Software-Defined Rack-Scale Storage System with Network-Storage Co-Design
RackBlox is our software-defined rack-scale storage architecture built with network-storage co-design.


## 1. Overview

This README outlines the contents of the repo and how to test the functionality of the artifact.
Please note that due to confidentiality with certain parts of the code used to produce this artifact, it is necessary for the AE reviewers
to use our testbed. 

We are currently working with the Campus IT staff to provide remote access to our testbed as soon as possible.
We will update how to access the cluster once this is ready on HotCRP as well as more concrete steps to evaluate within it.

## 2. Code
Each directory has a README that gives a brief overview of the code inside. The key artifacts are the p4 code and the vssd code that
implement the functionality described in the paper.
